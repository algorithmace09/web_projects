            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other media, by using tags. HTML provides the basic skeleton or structure of a webpage, specifying where elements should be placed and how they are organized.-s

            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the look and layout of HTML elements. While HTML defines the structure, CSS defines how the content is presented, such as colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and overall design. CSS allows for separation between content (HTML) and presentation (styling), making web pages easier to manage and update.
           
            Together, HTML and CSS work hand in hand to create visually appealing, well-structured websites. HTML provides the content, and CSS ensures it looks attractive and functions well on different devices and screen sizes.

            HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the structure for web pages by using a system of elements, often referred to as "tags," that define the various parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. HTML is not a programming language but a markup language, meaning it is used to annotate text so that browsers can interpret and display content correctly. The basic building blocks of HTML are elements wrapped in angle brackets and these elements can include attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as an image’s source (src) or a link’s destination (href).

                One of the key features of HTML is its use ofs a hierarchical structure, where content is organized into parent and child elements. For example, a webpage will typically contain a head section for metadata and a body section for the visible content, such as text and images. HTML also supports nesting elements, meaning one element can be placed inside another to create more complex layouts. It works alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design and JavaScript for interactivity. HTML is essential for creating accessible, well-structured websites that function correctly across different browsers and devices. Over time, HTML has evolved, with HTML5 being the current version, introducing new features such as multimedia elements (like <audio> and <video>) and semantic tags to improve accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
